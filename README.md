# Memory Game
Game is really simple. Once you've downloaded this repository, all you have to do is to open index html. Then, you need to finish the game with least moves as possible, in order to get 3 stars. Game difficulties:
* < 12 moves => 3 stars (expert)
* < 18 moves => 2 stars (advanced)
* > 18 moves => 1 star  (newbie)


# The Code
The project consits of 3 main files, one .html, one .js and one .cs. I have used jquery JavaScript library for the good functionality of the application and buttons. Html was used to build the scheleton of the app and CSS was being used for a better stiling and user-friendliness of the webpage.
